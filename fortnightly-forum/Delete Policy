-- Policy 3: Allow authenticated users to delete questions
-- WARNING: This allows ANY authenticated user to delete ANY question.
-- Adjust the USING clause based on your specific authorization needs.
-- For example, to only allow deletion by an admin role:
-- USING (auth.role() = 'admin')
-- Or to allow deletion only by the user who created it (if you store user_id):
-- USING (auth.uid() = user_id) -- Assuming you add a user_id column
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes" ON public.questions
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated'); -- Or adjust as needed
